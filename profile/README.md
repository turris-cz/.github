## Introduction

In the beginning, there was a research project in the Czech Republic by .CZ
domain registry **CZ.NIC, z.s.p.o**. There were developed and created Turris 1.x
routers, which helps users be protected and safe against Internet security
threats in exchange to be part of the data collection system.

We received a lot of feedback from the people that they wanted to be involved,
and later on, we created two crowdfunding campaigns on Indiegogo.

-   [Turris
    Omnia](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/turris-omnia-hi-performance-open-source-router#/)
    raised more than $1,2M
-   [Turris
    MOX](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/turris-mox-modular-open-source-router#/),
    the modular router - raised ~$400k

All Turris devices use Turris OS, which is based on the top of OpenWrt. It means
that we are not fork and try to contribute and cooperate with upstream projects
as much as possible.

We provide automatic updates, attack detection threat system and so many
features. Our source code is open-source.
